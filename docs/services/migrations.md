The Migrations service allows you to transfer data to your Appwrite instance through a simple API or the Appwrite console.

The Migrations service supports multiple providers including Appwrite projects, Firebase, Supabase and NHost with more providers coming soon.

We highly recommend using the dedicated wizard in the console rather than use the API directly.
